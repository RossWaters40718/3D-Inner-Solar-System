# 3D-Inner-Solar-System
To create a setup file using Inno setup compiler, After running pyinstaller or
auto-py-to-py-exe, create a new folder in the _internal folder named astroquery.
Copy the CITATION file from _internal/astropy to _internal/astroquery before
running Inno Setup Compiler. This is also necessary for the executable to work properly.
Don't know why this is! Maybe someone else knows?
